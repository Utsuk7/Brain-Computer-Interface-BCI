# Gaming Accessibility Project with Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) üéÆüß†

## Project Overview
The project aims to enhance gaming accessibility for individuals with specific special needs by integrating Unreal Engine game development with Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. Traditional gaming interfaces often pose barriers for people with physical disabilities, limiting their participation in recreational activities and access to stress management tools. Leveraging Unreal Engine's advanced graphics and intuitive design tools, alongside BCI technology's ability to interpret brain signals for control, we create an inclusive gaming environment tailored to diverse user needs.

## Achievements
- **Control 3D objects:** Successfully controlled movement using mental commands (left, right, neutral, lift) with the Emotiv BCI headset.

## Current Work
- **Integration with Unreal Engine:** Developing seamless integration of BCI controls within the Unreal Engine game environment.
- **Unity Development:** Using Unity to build training and simulation games for testing BCI controls.

## Future Scope
- **Generalized Virtual Controller:** Developing a virtual controller integrated with BCI mental commands to play any game available on the Play Store.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Quality of Life:** Improved access to gaming and relaxation tools for individuals with special needs.
- **Social Inclusion:** Fostering social inclusion through accessible gaming experiences.
- **Mental Well-being:** Exploring therapeutic benefits of gaming for stress management and relaxation.

This project has the potential to significantly enhance the gaming landscape, promoting equity and accessibility for millions worldwide. üåç‚ú®
